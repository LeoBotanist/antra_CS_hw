1.  phone number: string
    height: float or double
    age: int
    gender: enum
    salary: decimal
    book;s ISBN: string
    price: decimal
    shipping weight: float or double
    population: long
    number of stars: BigInteger
    number of employees: int
    
2.  value types are stored in the stack while ref types in the heap
    value types contain actual data while ref contains references
    value types won't be collected by GC
    value types can be created by struct or enum hile ref type can be created by class, interface, delegate or array
    value types won't accept null while ref types will
    
    Boxing is converting value type to ref type, unboxing is the other way around
3.  Managed Resource is managed by .NET runtime, will be collected by GC
    Unmanaged Resource is managed by OS, like file handles, database connections
    
4. GC is to automatically manage memory by reclaiming memory occupied by unreachable objects


Controlling Flow and Converting Types
1.  Throws a System.DivideByZeroException
2.  Returns an infinity, could be positive or negative
3.  Overflow will wrap around to the minimum or maximum value of int type
4.  x = y++, x is assigned the value of y, then y increments
    x = ++y, y increments then x is assigned.
5.  Break: Exits the loop;
    Continue: Skip current iteration only
    Return: Exits current method
6.  Initialization, condition, iteration, none is required
7.  = is assignment operator, == is equality operator
8.  Yes, it's an infinite loop
9.  _ represents the default case
10. IEnumerable
